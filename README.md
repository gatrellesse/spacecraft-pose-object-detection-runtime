# Satellite Detection Enhancement

## Overview
This is a fork project that enhances satellite detection in the Pose Bowl dataset using a combination of **Pandas**, **YOLO**, and **data splitting techniques**. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of satellite identification in images by leveraging advanced machine learning and data preprocessing techniques.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing with Pandas**: Cleaning, transforming, and organizing the dataset efficiently.
- **YOLO-based Satellite Detection**: Utilizing YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection.
- **Optimized Data Splitting**: Implementing effective training-validation-test splits to improve model generalization.
